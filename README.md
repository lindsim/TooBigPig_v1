Too Big Pig is a number guessing game built using Javascript. The player chooses a size for the pig to be (the pig size-shifts using pig magic) and the pig chills in the mud puddle. 

The player earns more points the closer the pig is to the maximum size it can be while still fitting in the puddle. If the pig doesn't fit in the puddle, it's TOO BIG PIG! and the game is over.
